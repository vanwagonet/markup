/// `<embed>`: The Embed External Content element
///
/// The `<embed>` HTML element embeds external content at the specified point in the document.
/// This content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser plug-in.
///
/// Keep in mind that most modern browsers have deprecated and removed support for browser plug-ins,
/// so relying upon `<embed>` is generally not wise if you want your site to be operable on the average user's browser.
