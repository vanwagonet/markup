/// `<object>`: The External Object element
///
/// The `<object>` HTML element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a nested browsing context,
/// or a resource to be handled by a plugin.
///
/// Keep in mind that most modern browsers have deprecated and removed support for browser plug-ins,
/// so relying upon `<object>` is generally not wise if you want your site to be operable on the average user's browser.
